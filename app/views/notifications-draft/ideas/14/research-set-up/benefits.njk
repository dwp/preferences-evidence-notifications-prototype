        Checkbox group for benefit selection. 
        We do this so research participants see only the benefits they actually receive in the test.
        Selected benefits are categorized into three groups:

        1. inScope array:
           - Benefits that we can provide proof of to users through this service

        2. oOScope array (out of scope):
           - Benefits that we cannot provide proof of through this service
           - Users will need to contact relevant departments for these benefits

        3. uCBenefit boolean (Universal Credit):
           - Technically an out of scope benefit but handled separately
           - Tracked independently because it requires specific messaging to users
           - Users are directed to their UC portal instead
