  <p>Preferences, Evidence and Notifications (PEN) is a series of components that will enable customers to select contact preferences and alternative formats for communications, upload evidence and check notifications related to claims. Customers will be able to go online to complete these tasks without the need to phone in or write to DWP.</p>
  <p>PEN will also allow agents to change contact preferences for customers across multiple benefit lines, check what evidence has been uploaded and what notifications customers have received.</p>

  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
    Initially, PEN will form part of Customer and Colleague View, but it will be designed and developed to be a reusable component that can be added to additional services in the future.  </div>
